Images are just 72px square and only updated every two\n          minutes. They are so small that you can place the window all the time\n          near the left edge of your desktop. Images are sent each other in a\n          peer-to-peer manner and not stored anywhere. The link represents a\n          virtual room and all room members can see each other. Be careful not\n          to leak the link to unwanted person.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <h1>Face List and Gather Area</h1>\n        <p>\n          On the left of the screen, you will see faces in a column, which we\n          call face list and the rest is what we call gather area. In the gather\n          area, you can drag your avatar, and the location is shared with\n          others. We can define regions in the gather area. Regions can be just\n          background or add some features. There is a preset you can choose when\n          creating a new room.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <h1>Real-time communication</h1>\n        <p>\n          One of the regions is called &quot;Meeting&quot; in which you can talk\n          with others in the same meeting region. The face becomes a small video\n          in the meeting region. We can create as many meeting regions as we\n          want. There is another region called &quot;Media&quot;, with which we\n          can share screens and videos in high resolution. &quot;Chat&quot;\n          region is to text. The chat texts are not stored anywhere other than\n          all connected peers.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    {!hideHowto && (\n      <div className=\"Landing-howto\">\n        <h2>Getting started</h2>\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            You or someone needs to create a new room.
